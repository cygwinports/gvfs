sdesc: "GNOME virtual filesystem"
ldesc: "gvfs is a userspace virtual filesystem designed to work with the 
i/o abstractions of gio (a library availible in glib >= 2.15.1). It 
installs several modules that are automatically used by applications 
using the APIs of libgio. There is also fuse support that allows 
applications not using gio to access the gvfs filesystems."
